# Task Plan: Prompt Optimizer Agent Improvements

## Objective
Restructure the prompt optimizer agent to focus specifically on prompt optimization rather than general prompt engineering.

## Task List

- [x] 1. Analyze current content structure and identify optimization-specific elements
- [x] 2. Create new content focused on prompt optimization workflow
- [x] 3. Add prompt diagnostic framework
- [x] 4. Create before/after optimization examples library
- [x] 5. Add quick optimization checklist
- [x] 6. Streamline content to remove general prompt creation material
- [x] 7. Add validation framework for prompt improvements
- [x] 8. Create final optimized version
- [x] 9. Test and validate the new structure
